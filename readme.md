# Introduction

My name is LIN CHIA-CHENG, and I am on a journey to acquire basic system design knowledge. This repository will serve as a collection of my learnings, homeworks, projects, and resources related to this class. I aim to understand the fundamental principles and best practices that underpin scalable and efficient systems.
